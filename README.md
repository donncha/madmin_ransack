# Madmin Ransack
A plugin for [Madmin](https://github.com/excid3/madmin) to use [Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack) for filtering resources.

This is a "re-write" of [Administrate Ransack](https://github.com/blocknotes/administrate_ransack) so that it works with Madmin, necessitated by Jumpstart Rails switching out Administrate for Madmin as its backend admin UI.

At this stage, it works for me so far, but I haven't put a lot of time into cleaning up the rough edges yet.
